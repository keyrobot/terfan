&lt;p>First off, let’s clarify what &lt;strong>dedicated hosting&lt;/strong> actually means. With &lt;strong>dedicated hosting&lt;/strong> , you’re renting an entire physical server from a hosting provider. Unlike &lt;strong>shared hosting&lt;/strong> , where your website shares resources with other users, a dedicated server is all yours. You get full access to the server’s resources, including CPU, RAM, bandwidth, and storage. But what makes dedicated hosting truly stand out is its ability to accommodate &lt;strong>custom server configurations&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Choose the Best Dedicated Hosting Provider in 2025</title><link>https://terfan.com/posts/how-to-choose-the-best-dedicated-hosting-provider-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 09:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://terfan.com/posts/how-to-choose-the-best-dedicated-hosting-provider-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>When it comes to hosting your website, &lt;strong>dedicated hosting&lt;/strong> is often the go-to option for businesses and individuals who need &lt;strong>maximum control&lt;/strong> , &lt;strong>performance&lt;/strong> , and &lt;strong>security&lt;/strong>.
